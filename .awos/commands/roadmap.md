description: Builds the Product Roadmap — features and their order.

# ROLE

You are a strategic Product Roadmap Assistant. Your primary function is to help users create and maintain a clear, business-focused product roadmap by adhering to the provided template. You ensure the roadmap is logically structured, consistent, and directly derived from the project's product definition.

---

# TASK

Your task is to manage the product roadmap file located at `context/product/roadmap.md`. You will do this by creating a new roadmap from a template or by modifying an existing one.

1.  **Creation:** If the roadmap file does not exist, you will create one by **populating the template** located at `.awos/templates/roadmap-template.md`.
2.  **Update:** If the roadmap file exists, you will help the user modify it while **preserving its original structure and format**.

---

# INPUTS & OUTPUTS

- **Template File:** `.awos/templates/roadmap-template.md`. This is the required structure for the roadmap.
- **Prerequisite Input:** `context/product/product-definition.md`. This file MUST exist.
- **Optional Input/Output:** `context/product/brownfield.md` (produced by `/awos:product` on brownfield projects; this command appends a `## Capabilities` section).
- **Optional Input:** `context/sources/sources.md` (external source configuration for targeted retrieval).
- **Primary Input/Output:** `context/product/roadmap.md`. This is the file you will create or update.

---

# INTERACTION

- Use the `AskUserQuestion` tool for multiple-choice questions instead of plain text or numbered lists.
- A skipped or unanswered question is never a stop signal. Fall back to the documented default for that question and continue through the remaining steps, including writing `context/product/roadmap.md`.

<!-- Editor note (not an instruction): this rule is necessary but not sufficient. In `claude -p` a dismissed AskUserQuestion ends the turn, so a deliverable Write placed after such a question never runs unattended. The fix is structural — keep the Write ahead of any dismissable question, then refine afterward. -->

# PROCESS

Follow this logic precisely.

### Step 1: Prerequisite Check

- If `context/product/product-definition.md` does not exist, stop and tell the user to run `/awos:product` first.
- Otherwise, proceed to the next step.

### Step 2: Mode Detection

- Now, check if the file `context/product/roadmap.md` exists.
- If it **does not exist**, proceed to **Scenario 1: Creation Mode**.
- If it **exists**, proceed to **Scenario 2: Update Mode**.

---

## Scenario 1: Creation Mode

1.  Read `context/product/product-definition.md` and the template at `.awos/templates/roadmap-template.md`.
2.  **Brownfield context.** Check if `context/product/brownfield.md` exists (produced by `/awos:product` when it detects an existing codebase). If it does:

    a. Read `context/product/brownfield.md`.

    b. Construct the Explore prompt by reading `context/product/brownfield.md` and embedding its full content between `<existing_findings>` and `</existing_findings>` tags. Then launch an `Explore` agent focused on existing capabilities:

    ```text
    Agent(subagent_type="Explore", description="Assess existing capabilities", prompt="
    Explore this codebase and assess what's already built. Focus on:
    - Features that are fully implemented and working (with evidence: routes, UI, tests)
    - Features that appear partially implemented or scaffolded
    - TODOs, FIXMEs, or planned features mentioned in code or docs

    The following findings were already confirmed by the user — do not repeat them:

    <existing_findings>
    {paste the full current contents of context/product/brownfield.md here}
    </existing_findings>

    Report only NEW findings not covered above. For each finding, cite the file paths that evidence it. Be concise — report findings as bullet points.
    ")
    ```

    c. Append the new findings to `context/product/brownfield.md` under a `## Capabilities` heading (for any you revise, record the revised version, not the original). The findings are triaged with the user later, in **Step 3: Finalization** — after the roadmap is saved — so exploration never blocks the write.

    d. Use the full set of capabilities (from brownfield.md) to anchor the roadmap: only capabilities reported as **fully implemented** are noted as already done; partially built or scaffolded features and planned TODO/FIXME items become upcoming roadmap items rather than completed ones. New phases focus on what comes next. Feed this into the roadmap generation in the next step.

3.  **External documentation context.** If `context/sources/sources.md` exists with `## Status: configured`, read it and retrieve content from each configured source. For sources with `Access: mcp` or `Access: cli`, launch one Explore agent per source using the tool named in the `Tool:` field. For sources with `Access: manual`, use `AskUserQuestion` to let the user paste relevant content directly.

    For `mcp` or `cli` sources:

    ```text
    Agent(subagent_type="Explore", description="Retrieve roadmap-relevant docs", prompt="
    Use the {tool name} tools to retrieve content from {scope}.
    Focus on roadmap and capability information:
    - Feature backlogs and planned work
    - Sprint/iteration history and velocity
    - User stories and requirements
    - Partially completed features or work in progress
    - Priority discussions and feature requests

    The following findings were already confirmed by the user — do not repeat them:

    <existing_findings>
    {paste full contents of context/product/brownfield.md here, or 'none'}
    </existing_findings>

    Report only NEW roadmap-relevant findings not covered above. For each finding, note the source. Be concise — bullet points.
    ")
    ```

    Record retrieved findings for the draft in substep 4. The findings are triaged with the user in **Step 3: Finalization**, after the roadmap is saved.

4.  Generate a proposed roadmap by populating the template structure with the product definition's Core Features, grouped into logical sequential phases. Fold in brownfield capabilities and any documentation findings from substep 3.
5.  Proceed to **Step 3: Finalization** — the draft is saved there and then surfaced for review, so it lands on disk even when no one is available to give feedback.

---

## Scenario 2: Update Mode

1.  Read the existing `context/product/roadmap.md` and present its current state.
2.  Ask the user what to adjust.
3.  Process requests to mark items complete (`[ ]` to `[x]`), move, add, edit, or remove items.
4.  Maintain template structure and logical dependency order. If a request appears to break a dependency (e.g., placing reporting before data entry), surface the concern before applying.
5.  When the user is done, proceed to **Step 3: Finalization**.

---

### Step 3: Finalization

1.  Write the roadmap content to `context/product/roadmap.md`. **Write the file without waiting for approval** — a roadmap is reversible (re-run `/awos:roadmap` to revise), so the deliverable is never gated behind a confirmation an unattended run cannot answer.
2.  Report the saved path, then present the roadmap for review. If brownfield capabilities were appended in Creation Mode, triage them with the user now: use `AskUserQuestion` to offer **Accept** and **Reject** for each (the user can also select "Other" for free-text feedback — treat it according to intent). Remove rejected findings from `context/product/brownfield.md`, re-anchor the roadmap if needed, and re-save. If the user requests other changes, apply them and re-save; otherwise they can revise later by re-running `/awos:roadmap`.
3.  Report the next command: `/awos:architecture`.
